## -Infant_Monitoring_and_Alert_System

Designed and implemented a comprehensive hardware and software solution to monitor an infant's vital signs in real time. The system integrated Arduino-UNO and NodeMCU with an Android application, leveraging Firebase for data synchronization. Key features include:

Real-time Monitoring: Continuously tracked the infant's health metrics, such as heart rate, oxygen levels, and environmental conditions, ensuring high accuracy in data collection.
Hardware Integration: The Arduino-UNO collected sensor data via the I2C protocol and communicated it to the NodeMCU through serial communication.
Data Transmission: The NodeMCU acted as a server, forwarding sensor data to Firebase and SQL databases, which were accessible through the Android app.
Key Components:

NodeMCU, Arduino-UNO, Sound Sensor Module, MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter & Heart Rate Sensor, DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor, Camera Module.
Technologies Used:

Embedded C, MIT App Inventor (for Android app development), SQL, Firebase.
